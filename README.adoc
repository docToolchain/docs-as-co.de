This repository hosts the source for the https://docs-as-co.de website.
It is based on

* Jekyl as static site generator
* AsciiDoc as markup language
* https://jaxenter.de/hitchhikers-guide-docs-code-asciidoctor-jekyll-73753[this Java Magazin article] on how to implement it

Since github does not support AsciiDoc for github pages, the website is hosted at https://netlify.com .

Start in https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/docToolchain/docs-as-co.de[gitpod.io]

command to build docs:

```cd docs && bundle install && jekyll build && ./gradlew htmlSanityCheck```
