== Quickstart

There are several ways to get quickly started with the Docs-as-Code approach.

The Quickstart basically consists of creating and rendering your first AsciiDoc document.

=== The Zero-Dependencies Approach

You just want to give AsciiDoc a try without installing anything?

Go to https://asciidoclive.com[AsciiDocLIVE] and use an online editor with preview.

=== The dtcw Wrapper Approach (recommended)

The recommended way to use docToolchain is with the `dtcw` wrapper script, which simplifies installation and usage.

--
.> use dtcw Wrapper

First, download the wrapper script into your project directory:

For Linux/macOS:
[source,bash]
----
cd <your project>
curl -Lo dtcw https://doctoolchain.org/dtcw
chmod +x dtcw
----

For Windows PowerShell:
[source,powershell]
----
cd <your project>
Invoke-WebRequest doctoolchain.org/dtcw.ps1 -OutFile dtcw.ps1
----

The wrapper script will handle installation of docToolchain when you run your first command.

To download a template (like arc42):
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw downloadTemplate
----

To see all available tasks:
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw tasks --group=doctoolchain
----

To generate HTML from your AsciiDoc files:
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw generateHTML
----

To generate PDF:
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw generatePDF
----

If you want to create your first document, write it in AsciiDoc format:

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

For more detailed information, see the [official documentation](https://doctoolchain.github.io/docToolchain/v2.0.x/010_manual/20_install.html).

=== The Editor Approach

If you are willing to install an editor or a plugin for your favorite IDE, you can install one of the following editors with the corresponding plugins:

* https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciiDocFX]
* https://atom.io/users/asciidoctor[Atom]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[Visual Studio Code]
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[IntelliJ]
* https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/asciidoctor-editor[Eclipse]

=> see also our German article about https://jaxenter.de/hitchhikers-guide-to-docs-as-code-tools-fuer-asciidoc-asciidoctor-70828[Tools for AsciiDoc]

=== The Build-Tool Approach

"You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door."footnote:[If you are born after 1980 - this is a famous quote from Zork1, a text adventure created by Infocom]

There is a *Maven*, a *Gradle* and a *Command-Line-Tool* nearby.

What will you choose?

.Command-Line
[role='primary']
--

.> use Command-Line-Tool

You install *asciidoctorj* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----


You then convert it via

    asciidoctorj test.adoc

--

.Maven
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Maven

you are likely to be eaten by a grue.

You install *Maven* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You then download the build file from github, because it is too big to be just typed in:

.maven.pom footnote:[taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-examples/master/asciidoc-to-html-example/pom.xml]
[source,xml]
----
include::_pages/getstarted/maven.pom[]
----


...and convert your document via

    mvn asciidoc

--

.Gradle
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Gradle

Good choice!
A fairy appears and grants you a wish.
You wish for a very simple build file and the following line of text appears:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins { id "org.asciidoctor.convert", version "1.5.3", }
----

you write your very first AsciiDoc document and put it in `/src/docs/asciidoc/`

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You install Gradle via https://sdkman.io[sdkman]
and convert the file with

    gradle asciidoc

a nicely styled html file appears in `/build/asciidoc/html5/.`
